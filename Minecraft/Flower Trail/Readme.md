In this program we are going to make a flower trail that follows you wherever you walk!

Navigate to 'Player' on the side panel (1) and find 'on player walk' and then drag it into the code window

 ## Step 4
 Change the *grass block* to be a Dandelion. It should look like below. You can now walk around and then look behind you to see if you should have a trail of dandelions following you. If you walk backwards you should be able to see them appearing infront of you.</br>
